# scSecurity
This repository contains the source code and content for a smart contract audit textbook, 
written using mdbook. The textbook covers the fundamental concepts and principles of smart contract security,
including common vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and best practices for writing secure code. 
It also discusses the process of auditing smart contracts, including the tools and techniques that can be used to identify 
and mitigate vulnerabilities and issues.
