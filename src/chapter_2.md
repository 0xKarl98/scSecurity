# Chapter 2: Basics of Smart Contract Security 

In this chapter, we will introduce the fundamental concepts and principles of smart contract security. We will discuss common vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and provide an overview of best practices for writing secure smart contract code.

One of the key challenges in securing smart contracts is that they are typically executed on a decentralized, trustless network, such as a blockchain. This means that there is no central authority or intermediary to enforce the contract's terms or resolve disputes. Instead, the contract's code must be written in such a way that it is immune to tampering or exploitation, and can be trusted by all parties involved.

To achieve this, smart contract developers must be aware of common vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and take steps to mitigate them. Some of the most common vulnerabilities include:

- Reentrancy attacks: This type of attack occurs when a contract's code is executed multiple times, allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state or steal funds.

- Denial of service (DoS) attacks: This type of attack occurs when an attacker floods a contract with requests, making it unavailable or unresponsive to legitimate users.

- Unchecked call failures: This type of attack occurs when a contract fails to handle errors or exceptions properly, leading to unexpected behavior or exceptions properly, leading to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
Integer overflows and underflows: This type of attack occurs when a contract uses integer data types that are not sufficiently large to handle large or complex calculations, leading to incorrect results or vulnerabilities.

- Unsafe contract interactions: This type of attack occurs when a contract interacts with other contracts or external sources in an unsafe or insecure manner, potentially exposing the contract to vulnerabilities.

To prevent these and other vulnerabilities, smart contract developers must follow best practices for writing secure code. Some of the key principles to follow include:

- Validate inputs: Ensure that all inputs to a contract are valid and conform to the expected format, to prevent attackers from providing malicious or incorrect data.
- Use safe libraries and modules: Leverage established, well-reviewed libraries and modules to handle common tasks and functions, rather than writing custom code.
- Use secure contract patterns: Follow established patterns and frameworks for writing secure smart contract code, such as the OpenZeppelin library.
Test thoroughly: Test the contract's code thoroughly, using a variety of test cases and scenarios, to ensure that it is robust and reliable.

By following these and other best practices, smart contract developers can help to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities and attacks, and ensure that their contracts are secure and trustworthy. In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the specifics of smart contract security, and discuss the tools and techniques that can be used to audit and secure smart contracts.
