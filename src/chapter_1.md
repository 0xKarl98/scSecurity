# Chapter 1 About security audit 

As with any complex technology, smart contract audits come with certain limitations and risks that must be carefully considered. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the key warnings and limitations to be aware of when performing a smart contract audit.

First and foremost, it is important to recognize that no audit is 100% comprehensive or foolproof. There is always a possibility that a contract may contain vulnerabilities or issues that are not detected by the audit process. This is why it is important to use a combination of different tools and techniques, and to review the contract code carefully and thoroughly.

Additionally, it is important to note that smart contract audits are not a substitute for good contract design and development practices. A well-written and tested contract is the best defense against vulnerabilities and issues, and a thorough audit should be seen as an additional layer of security, rather than a replacement for good coding practices.

Finally, it is important to remember that smart contract audits are not a one-time event. As the contract and its environment evolve over time, new vulnerabilities and issues may arise. It is therefore important to regularly review and audit contracts, to ensure that they remain secure and reliable.

Overall, while smart contract audits can provide valuable insights and help to identify potential vulnerabilities and issues, they are not a panacea for all security concerns. It is important to approach smart contract audits with a realistic understanding of their limitations, and to use them as part of a broader security strategy.
